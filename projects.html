                    <h6>Website for Animal Shelter "Mežavairogi"</h6>
                    <p>In 2023 I participated in the Riga TechGirls program "Tech Mentor" where I had a chance to apply for practice projects and work on the real-life project. I applied for a project whose aim was to build a new website for an animal shelter in Latvia - "Mežavairogi".
                        <br><br>In my team, I worked together with one project manager, one product owner, two UX/UI designers, one front-end developer, and two Q&A testers. We had also a project mentor because all team members were only learning and weren't working in those IT fields. This project was a chance to gain experience for everyone.
                        <br><br>I developed the homepage, navigation bar in the header, footer, sections "Par mums" with subsections, and also section "Adoptē" with all subsections. All those pages were developed in desktop, tablet, and mobile versions. The tools that I used to develop this page were WordPress and Elementor Pro.</p>

                    <h6>Tip Calculator App</h6>
                    <p>Tip Calculator App is a self-study project built with React.js. This project was built within the Riga TechGirls program "Tech Mentor" 2023 and with the help and advice of my mentor.
                        <br><br>At the start, I created HTML and CSS and after that, I added functionality with React.js. The "Splitter" is a calculator that splits tip between people and calculates tip per person and the total amount per person. This App is responsive in desktop, tablet, and mobile versions. </p>

                    <h6>VanLife project</h6>
                    <p>In 2023 I participated in the Riga TechGirls program "Tech Mentor" where I together with my Front-end mentor decided that the next logical step would be for me to learn React. I started with the Scrimba.com Learn React course where I learned the basics of React - Static Pages (JSX, Custom components, Styling), Data-driven Pages (Props, Mapping data), Interactive web apps (Event listeners, State, Conditional rendering, Forms, Side effects).
                        <br><br>Within Learn React I built a simple React info site and after that, I had my first solo project - A Digital business card. Later within this course, I built an AirBnb Experiences clone and a second solo project - A Travel journal. After that, I built an interactive meme generator, where you can generate images and add some text. At the end of this course, I created a Tenzies game where you need to generate numbers and click on the same ones till you see all the same numbers.
                        <br><br>After Learn React I continued with the next course from Scrimba - Learn Class Components in React. That was a short course only about class components.
                        <br><br>After this course, I decided to keep going and started another course in Scrimba - Learn React Router 6. Within this course, I created a VanLife project where a user can log in to the page, search for particular vans and explore some other options.</p>
